## Overview

### Progress
**Week 1**
- Able to have an initial start-up code based on the to-do list application.
- finished table of contents, shows entries
- Challenges with changing the original code to fit the aesthetic and requirements for this application.
- next steps would be to customize the overall look of the app UI/UX
- also to work on automating some properties, like dates and adding different buttons

**Week 2**
- Got login and sign up pages and implemented navigation plus user authorization using Firebase
- Challenging in using Firebase
- Challenge to connect different pages and make efficient navigation
- next steps to fix UI/UX and add more databases so that userId can correspond to its own diary entries
  

### Description

Marvels and Oddities is a digital diary that can be used to capture ones thoughts and feelings through words. Photos and videos are able to capture ones physical appearances over time, but writing down your thoughts and feelings capture your maturity and the way you felt during certain moments in life. The goal of this app is to capture ones daily Marvels or Oddities, inspired from a book _Love From A to Z_. 

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
  - Lifestyle/Social
- **Mobile:**
    - Write from wherever and whenever. Ability to add photos and location features if needed. 
- **Story:**
    - In a world of social media, and constantly having photos and thoughts being percieved by other people, this application allows privacy. Allows you to store your thoughts and feelings for only your own sake to look back upon. Your safe space online.
- **Market:**
  - Audience to those who have a lot of thoughts they want to be able to capture. Towards a young audience who love to read and write. 
- **Habit:**
  - The goal would be to use the app every day, even just a sentence or a word. Add streaks or some type of counter to push the users to constantly write.
  - Average user only creates, does not consume. But might later on add features to consume and create. 
- **Scope:**
  - Not challenging to build, really similar to a to do list or note application.
  - Might be challenging to add photo features and location features.
